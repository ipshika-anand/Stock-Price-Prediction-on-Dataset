# Stock-Prices-Prediction-Using-RNN-LSTM
We'll divide this into two parts: 1) Data Preprocessing 2)Building the RNN Model and with the help of it,do the prediction of the stockusing the data from datasetss!

#### IN PART 1 WE'LL BE SEEING:

Importing the libraries
Importing the training set
Feature Scaling
Training the dataset
Reshaping the dataset

### IN PART 2 WE'LL BE SEEING:

Importing the Keras libraries and packages
Initialising,adding layers,compiling and fitting the RNN
Visualising the results
